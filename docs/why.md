# Why?

[Arabic fonts on the internet are always too small](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/why-are-arabic-fonts-so-small)
and the Chrome virtual/on-screen keyboard
[Google Input Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-input-tools/mclkkofklkfljcocdinagocijmpgbhab)
is also affected. Unfortunately it's not open-source. Thus this Chrome extension on top of it to
make it readable.
